For the background audio wav file, I recorded a small clip of a group of students talking near me at the Student center. And for the voiceover clip, I recorded myself doing a small introduction of myself in Korean. I followed the script from a Korean learning textbook, and added in my personal info (like name, where I was born, where I lived, my school year, major, etc)
