To be honest, I did not put that much effort into this assignment, since it is extra credit. All the sound effects I used for this video were sound effects I made myself. I feel that since the human voice is very practical and can be used in multiple situations (opening the hologram phone, opening websites, keyboard tapping, etc), I decided to use my own voice to create all these sounds effects. These sounds effects can come in all different speeds and pitches, so I wanted to try to match all those cadences. I understand if I do not receive points for this assignment. Thank you for a great semester!
